### Telegram API

There are follow telegram methods:

```kotlin
interface TelegramApi {

	/**
	 * Send any content message
	 */
	fun send(message: SendMessage?): Any?

	/**
	 * A simple method for testing your bot's auth token. Requires no parameters.
	 * Returns basic information about the bot in form of a User object.
	 */
	fun getMe(): User

	/**
	 * There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot â€” the getUpdates method on one hand
	 * and Webhooks on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way,
	 * but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours.
	 *
	 * Regardless of which option you choose, you will receive JSON-serialized Update objects as a result.
	 */
	fun getUpdates(offset: Long? = null, timeout: Int? = null): List<Update>

	/**
	 * 	Use this method to send text messages. On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 */
	fun sendMessage(message: TextSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to copy messages of any kind. Service messages and invoice messages can't be copied.
	 * The method is analogous to the method forwardMessage, but the copied message doesn't have a link
	 * to the original message. Returns the MessageId of the sent message on success.
	 */
	fun copyMessage(message: CopySendMessage): MessageId

	/**
	 * Use this method to forward messages of any kind. Service messages can't be forwarded.
	 * On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 */
	fun forwardMessage(message: ForwardSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to copy messages of any kind. Service messages and invoice messages can't be copied.
	 * The method is analogous to the method forwardMessage, but the copied message doesn't have a link
	 * to the original message. Returns the MessageId of the sent message on success.
	 */
	fun sendPhoto(message: PhotoSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to send audio files, if you want Telegram clients to display them in the music player.
	 * Your audio must be in the .MP3 or .M4A format. On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 * Bots can currently send audio files of up to 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.
	 * For sending voice messages, use the sendVoice method instead.
	 */
	fun sendAudio(message: AudioSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to send general files. On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 * Bots can currently send files of any type of up to 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.
	 */
	fun sendDocument(message: DocumentSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to send video files, Telegram clients support mp4 videos
	 * (other formats may be sent as Document). On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 * Bots can currently send video files of up to 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.
	 */
	fun sendVideo(message: VideoSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to send animation files (GIF or H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video without sound).
	 * On success, the sent Message is returned. Bots can currently send animation files of up to 50 MB in size,
	 * this limit may be changed in the future.
	 */
	fun sendAnimation(message: AnimationSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to send audio files, if you want Telegram clients to display the file as a playable
	 * voice message. For this to work, your audio must be in an .OGG file encoded with OPUS
	 * (other formats may be sent as Audio or Document). On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 * Bots can currently send voice messages of up to 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.
	 */
	fun sendVoice(message: VoiceSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * As of v.4.0, Telegram clients support rounded square mp4 videos of up to 1 minute long.
	 * Use this method to send video messages. On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 */
	fun sendVideoNote(message: VideoNoteSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to send a group of photos, videos, documents or audios as an album.
	 * Documents and audio files can be only grouped in an album with messages of the same type.
	 * On success, an array of Messages that were sent is returned.
	 */
	fun sendMediaGroup(message: MediaGroupSendMessage): List<Message>

	/**
	 * Use this method to send point on the map. On success, the sent Message is returned.
	 */
	fun sendLocation(message: LocationSendMessage): Message

	 */
	fun sendPoll(message: PollSendMessage): Message

	/**
	 * Use this method to get a list of profile pictures for a user. Returns a UserProfilePhotos object.
	 */
	fun getUserProfilePhotos(message: GetUserProfilePhotosSendMessage): UserProfilePhotos

	/**
	 * Use this method to delete a message, including service messages, with the following limitations:
	 * - A message can only be deleted if it was sent less than 48 hours ago.
	 * - A dice message in a private chat can only be deleted if it was sent more than 24 hours ago.
	 * - Bots can delete outgoing messages in private chats, groups, and supergroups.
	 * - Bots can delete incoming messages in private chats.
	 * - Bots granted can_post_messages permissions can delete outgoing messages in channels.
	 * - If the bot is an administrator of a group, it can delete any message there.
	 * - If the bot has can_delete_messages permission in a supergroup or a channel, it can delete any message there.
	 * Returns True on success.
	 */
	fun deleteMessage(message: DeleteMessage): Boolean

	/**
	 * Use this method to send answers to callback queries sent from inline keyboards.
	 * The answer will be displayed to the user as a notification at the top of the chat screen or as an alert.

	fun getMyCommands(): List<BotCommand>

	/**
	 * Use this method to get basic info about a file and prepare it for downloading.
	 * For the moment, bots can download files of up to 20MB in size. On success,
	 * a File object is returned.
	 * The file can then be downloaded via the link https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<token>/<file_path>,
	 * where <file_path> is taken from the response. It is guaranteed that the link will be valid
	 * for at least 1 hour. When the link expires, a new one can be requested by calling getFile again.
	 */
	fun getFile(message: GetFileMessage): File

## Engine starter

Starter for simplify the creation process of any telegram bots on Kotlin. 

###  Connecting

__telesender-engine-starter__ has transitive dependency of __telesender-core-starter__.

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Gradle:

```
implementation("io.github.zh-efimenko.telesender:telesender-engine-starter:1.1.0")
```

Maven:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.zh-efimenko.telesender</groupId>
    <artifactId>telesender-engine-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Using

The library helps you work flexible and put your business logic to both special objects: __filters__
and __handlers__.

### Filters

The library contains some special filters for base aims of telegram's bots, but you can always
create your own filters, you just implement `TelegramFilter` interface.

#### Message filter

Message filter serves in order to process `MessageHandler` classes which contains business
logic to handle __*Messages*__ from telegram's chats.

#### CallbackQuery filter

CallbackQuery filter serves in order to process `CallbackQueryHandler` classes which contains
business logic to handle __*CallbackQueries*__ from telegram's chats.

#### Poll filter

Poll filter serves in order to process `PollHandler` classes which contains business logic to handle
__*Polls*__ from telegram's chats.

#### PollAnswer filter

PollAnswer filter serves in order to process `PollAnswerHandler` classes which contains business
logic to handle __*PollAnswers*__ from telegram's chats.

#### Cancel filter

Cancel filter serves in order to reset any state your application and start again. For these goals
every filter has special method __*clear*__ which helps you take care of resetting any states.

#### Unresolved filter

Unresolved filter serves in order to notice that your application does not understand chat's command.


### Handlers

#### Message handlers

In order to create one of them you need to implement `MessageHandler` interface and to put
your business logic.

For instance:

```kotlin
@Component
class GeneratorKeyHandler : MessageHandler {
	override fun getCommands(): Map<String, String> = mapOf("/generate_key" to "Generation of key")

	override fun getSteps(): Map<String, MessageHandlerStep<*>> = listOf(
		object : MessageHandlerStep<Int> {
			override fun getKey(): String = "length"

			override fun getQuestion(): MessageQuestionBlock = {
				TextSendMessage(chatId = it.message.chat.id, text = "What length?")
			}

			override fun getValidation(): MessageValidationBlock<Int> = {
				try {
					abs(it.text!!.toInt())
				} catch (e: Exception) {
					throw IllegalArgumentException("Incorrect length format")
				}
			}

			override fun getNextStepKey(): String? = null
		}
	).associateBy { it.getKey() }

	override fun getInitialStepKey(): String = "length"

	override fun getProcess(): MessageProcessBlock = { message, answers ->
		val length = answers["length"] as Int
		val key = (1..length)
			.map { Random.nextInt(0, 9) }
			.joinToString("")
		TextSendMessage(chatId = message.chat.id, text = "Generated key: $key")
	}
}
```

#### CallbackQuery handlers

In order to create one of them you need to implement `CallbackQueryHandler` interface and to put
your business logic.

For instance:

```kotlin
@Component
class CallbackTestHandler : CallbackQueryHandler {
	override fun getCommands(): Map<String, String> = mapOf("/yes" to "Answer yes")

	override fun getProcess(): CallbackQueryProcessBlock = { callbackQuery ->
		val key = Random(1000).nextInt().toString()
		TextSendMessage(chatId = callbackQuery.message!!.chat.id, text = key)
	}
}
```

#### Poll handlers

In order to create one of them you need to implement `PollHandler` interface and to put
your business logic.

For instance:

```kotlin
@Component
class PollHandlerTest : PollHandler {
	override fun getProcess(): PollProcessBlock = { poll -> 
		TODO("Any logic")
	}
}
```

#### PollAnswer handlers

In order to create one of them you need to implement `PollAnswerHandler` interface and to put
your business logic.

For instance:

```kotlin
@Component
class PollAnswerHandlerTest : PollAnswerHandler {
	override fun getProcess(): PollAnswerProcessBlock = { pollAnswer ->
		TODO("Any logic")
	}
}
```

## Setting up

```
telegram.bot.access-token =                      # api key (required)

telegram.admin.enabled = false                   # enabling admin mode (optional, default is false)
telegram.admin.chat-id = 0                       # admin telegram chat for monitor exception (optional)
  
telegram.filters.message.enabled = true          # optional, default is true
telegram.filters.callback-query.enabled = true   # optional, default is true
telegram.filters.poll.enabled = true             # optional, default is true
telegram.filters.poll-answer.enabled = true      # optional, default is true
telegram.filters.unresolved.enabled = true       # optional, default is true
telegram.filters.cancel.enabled = true           # optional, default is true

telegram.filters.cancel.commands = "/cancel:cancel"   # list of commands (optional, default is /cancel:cancel)
                                                      # format - /<command>:<description of command>
```
